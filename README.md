## Context

The idea behind this challenge was to create a independent game core mechanism (could be saw under _game) that has all behaviors for blackjack works, and after that create a simple React UI for attach and run the game based on 1 Player / Dealer. In that way could be easily attached in different other UI frameworks that rely on Typescript (approach choosed for use POO on Javascript).
